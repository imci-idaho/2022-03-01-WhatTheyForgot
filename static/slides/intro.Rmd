# Gitter vs Zoom Chat

#### If you an issue that needs immediate attention and will be totally irrelevant later (e.g. can't hear, class is moving too fast), <u>use Zoom chat</u>.

#### Everything else: <u>use Gitter</u>. Gitter is a persistent resource for discussion and troubleshooting. If you had a problem, chances are, someone else also had that problem.
